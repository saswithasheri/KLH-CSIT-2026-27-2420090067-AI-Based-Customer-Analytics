AI-Driven Customer Analytics for Purchase Prediction, Segmentation & Business Intelligence

Project Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to analyze and predict consumer purchase behavior from customer and e-commerce datasets. The proposed framework combines Machine Learning (ML), Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP and LIME, and an interactive Streamlit Business Intelligence dashboard to convert customer data into actionable business insights.

The overall workflow is:

Customer Data → Machine Learning → Explainable Insights → Business Decisions

Problem Statement

Customer purchase behavior is difficult to understand and predict because organizations generate complex datasets containing:

Transactions

Customer demographics

Spending patterns

Online behavior

Important relationships and purchasing patterns may remain hidden inside customer data. Organizations also need to predict:

Future purchases

Customer churn

Customer lifetime value

The project aims to convert these analytical findings into actionable marketing and sales decisions.

Objectives

To understand customer demographics, purchasing behavior, purchase patterns, and RFM analysis.

To predict future purchases, purchase frequency, customer churn, and customer lifetime value.

To optimize customer segmentation, product recommendation, customer engagement, and business decisions.

Literature Survey

The project reviews recent research from Springer Nature, IEEE, and ACM covering areas such as:

Customer buying behavior prediction

E-commerce customer shopping behavior

Consumer buying-intention prediction

Market basket analysis

Consumer purchase behavior

E-commerce recommendation systems

Online shopping behavior prediction

Purchase-intention classification

Machine learning in e-commerce

Intelligent customer segmentation

Research Gap

The project identifies four major gaps:

Fragmented Analysis
Customer analytics tasks are often handled independently.

Limited Explainability
Machine learning predictions may not clearly show which features drive the output.

Business Integration
ML models need stronger integration with interactive decision-support dashboards.

Multiple Objectives
Purchase prediction, segmentation, churn, and customer lifetime value can be addressed together.
